I need to receive the Recipe Labs V2 Platform dist folder on the VPS. The files are on my local machine but I need them on the VPS.

**Local machine location**: `/Users/simeonreid/AiSim Virtual Workspace/recipe-labs platform app/dist/`

**VPS destination**: `/var/www/recipe-labs-platform-v2/`

**Files needed**:
1. `index.html` (8.8 KB)
2. `assets/index-DJQ8ZZcd.js` (main JavaScript bundle, ~570 KB)
3. `assets/index-tn0RQdqM.css` (CSS file, small)

Since SCP requires SSH keys, help me set up the VPS directory and provide instructions for one of these options:

**Option 1**: Create the files directly on VPS (I can provide the file contents)
**Option 2**: Set up a temporary HTTP server on local machine to download from
**Option 3**: Use a different transfer method

First, create the directory structure on VPS:

```bash
mkdir -p /var/www/recipe-labs-platform-v2/assets
chmod -R 755 /var/www/recipe-labs-platform-v2
```

Then let me know which option you prefer, and I'll provide the file contents or download commands.
