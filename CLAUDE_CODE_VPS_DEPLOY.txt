Deploy the Recipe Labs V2 Platform to the VPS. I have the built application ready to deploy.

Here's what needs to be done:

1. **Create deployment directory**:
```bash
mkdir -p /var/www/recipe-labs-platform-v2
chmod 755 /var/www/recipe-labs-platform-v2
```

2. **Copy the built files** (the dist folder from the local build):
   - The dist folder contains: index.html, assets/ folder with JS and CSS
   - Copy all files from dist/ to /var/www/recipe-labs-platform-v2/

3. **Configure Nginx** to serve the application on port 3002:
```nginx
server {
    listen 3002;
    server_name 72.61.72.94;
    root /var/www/recipe-labs-platform-v2;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # Cache static assets
    location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg)$ {
        expires 1y;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
    }
}
```

4. **Enable the site**:
```bash
ln -sf /etc/nginx/sites-available/recipe-labs-platform-v2 /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
nginx -t
systemctl reload nginx
```

5. **Test the deployment**:
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:3002
```

6. **Verify Agent API is accessible**:
```bash
curl http://72.61.72.94:5000/health
```

The platform should be accessible at: http://72.61.72.94:3002

The Agent Chat Widget will automatically connect to the Recipe Labs Agent API at http://72.61.72.94:5000.

Show me the deployment steps and confirm when it's live.
